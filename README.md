# PaSuLi - Parametric Surface Library (in C)

## Warning: This project is still in development and clean up phase.

----

Parameteric Surface Library is a collection of functions for evaluating points on parameteric surfaces.

It does have more than 230 functions and also calculations for 1.st and 2.nd derivatives with respect to 1.st and 2.nd parameter (usually called u and v). 
It does also allow the calculation for normal vectors.

Evaluation of SuperFormula (first defined by Paul Bourke) is also possible.

----

## Roadmap:
March 2021: 
- Fixing and extending some evaluations.
- Code generation for other programming languages (especially JavaScript)
- Release of the first stable version 

April 2021:
- Evaluation of Bezier surfaces and NURBS
- Code generation for OpenCL
- "On the fly" code generation of executable code for x86/x64
