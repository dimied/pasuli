# PaSuLi - Parametric Surface Library (in C)

## Warning: This project is still in development and clean up phase.

----

Parameteric Surface Library is a collection of functions for evaluating points on parameteric surfaces.

It does have more than 230 functions and also calculations for 1.st and 2.nd derivatives with respect to 1.st and 2.nd parameter (usually called u and v). 
It does also allow the calculation for normal vectors.

Evaluation of SuperFormula (first defined by Paul Bourke) is also possible.
